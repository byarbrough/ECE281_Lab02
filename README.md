##4-bit 2â€™s Complement Adder/Subtracter

A Full Adder (or a 1 bit adder) takes a total of three inputs: Ain, Bin, and Cin. It then outputs Sum and Cout. The truth table for such a device looks like this:

The following Boolean Expressions were extracted from this table.

_Sum = A xor B xor Cin_

_Cout = AB + ACin + BCin_

These equations could be simulated with a testbench to verify that they match the truth table (Xout is Sum):

Seeing that the simulation does match the table, I crafted a schematic for what the circuit would look like.
